# Techwear Generator
This is a personal project that generates a cohesive techwear outfit based on user preferences. The data being pulled for this project's database is retrieved using webscrapers built for specific clothing sites. The front end is built in React using TypeScript as well TailwindCSS and its sister library HeadlessUI.
